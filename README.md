This is demo repo for our BMVC 2022 paper:<br>
[Fill in Fabrics: Body-Aware Self-Supervised Inpainting for Image-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00918)
<br>

Training details available in the official repo [fifa-tryon](https://github.com/hasibzunair/fifa-tryon).

### Interactive app build using [Gradio](https://gradio.app/)
You can use the model as a simple UI made with gradio. See [gradio_app](https://github.com/dktunited/fifa_demo/tree/master/gradio_app) for details on how to run the app. This app currently works on a local machine with a GPU. Can be hosted on a GPU server.

Note: I attempted to do a CPU implementation first. Got running the try-on and pose estimator models on CPU. The issue is when getting the parsing results (i.e multi-class segmentation) using [this](https://github.com/hasibzunair/Self-Correction-Human-Parsing-for-ACGPN.git) for the person image. The pre-trained model uses [In-Place Activated BatchNorm](https://github.com/mapillary/inplace_abn) for memory-optimized training. The implementation of In-Place Activated BatchNorm is currently only for GPUs. 

### Acknowledgements
This inference codebase is modified from https://github.com/levindabhi/ACGPN to run custom models. The human parser and segmentation models are from https://github.com/hasibzunair/Self-Correction-Human-Parsing-for-ACGPN and https://github.com/hasibzunair/U-2-Net.
